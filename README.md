## So, I've installed but how do I setup?
Excellent! These next steps will guide you through the instillation of the TicketBot.

 1. To get a bot token (as seen in the first step upon startup) you will need to create a bot user. An in-depth tutorial can be found at this link [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/discord.html). If you need any further assistance with this please do not hesitate to reach out to me!
 2. Choose your bot prefix (This is commonly set to '!' or '?')
 3. Choose what your bot will display as [Playing](https://why-am-i-he.re/mEqQkd.png)
 4. Should the bot say "Unknown Command" when it doesn't recognise a command (only true/false response accepted)
 5. Tickets support role ID (You can get this by escaping a mentioned role like this; "\@Role")

After this, press enter and the bot will launch for the first time! No more setup required.
