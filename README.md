## So, I have the dependencies. How do I setup?
Excellent! These next steps will guide you through the initial startup of the TicketBot.

To launch the bot for the first time, you will need to do the following.

 1. Clone this repository to your computer/server
 2. Ensure you have [.NET core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and [Node.JS v10 or later](https://nodejs.org/) installed
 3. Navigate to the directory in which you cloned the repository and if on mac/linux, mark it as an executable type file with ``chmod +x <filename>``
 4. Open the file and follow the instructions on screen!

### First-time installation:
 1. To get a bot token (as seen in the first step upon startup) you will need to create a bot user. An in-depth tutorial can be found at this link [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/discord.html). If you need any further assistance with this please do not hesitate to reach out to me!
 2. Their is a built-in guide within the client to help you get setup!
